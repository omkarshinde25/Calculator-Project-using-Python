## Project Title
Simple Calculator Program in Python

## Project Overview
This project is a basic calculator program developed in Python. It performs five mathematical operations which include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and average. The program is created using three main steps which are function creation, user input, and result display. This project is suitable for beginners learning Python functions and conditional statements.

## Step by Step Explanation

### Step 1: Create Functions
The calculator uses separate functions for each operation.

1. Function to add two numbers
2. Function to subtract two numbers
3. Function to multiply two numbers
4. Function to divide two numbers
5. Function to calculate the average of two numbers

Each function accepts two inputs and returns the output of the operation.

### Step 2: User Input
1. The program displays a menu with five operation options.
2. The user selects one operation from the list.
3. The user enters the first number.
4. The user enters the second number.
5. These values are used by the program to calculate the result.

### Step 3: Display Result
1. The program checks which option is selected.
2. Based on the selected option, the related function is executed.
3. The program prints the complete calculation and the final result.
4. If the user selects an invalid option, a message is displayed.

## Features
1. Clean and modular code using Python functions
2. Interaction with user input
3. Supports five essential arithmetic operations
4. Provides clear and readable output

## How to Run the Program
1. Save the file as Calculator_Many_Project.py
2. Open the terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the file location
4. Run the command: python Calculator_Many_Project.py

## Future Enhancements
1. Add error handling for division by zero
2. Add continuous calculation without restarting the program
3. Add more operations such as square, cube, and percentage
4. Improve input validation
